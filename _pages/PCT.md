Several private outpatient practices from the region will be available in an informal panel to allow our Cornell residents to network with and ask questions of practices that may be hiring this year. This will be a good time to introduce yourself to hiring groups and ask about clinic structure, interview advice, negotiation practices, compensation structures, etc.
